# gosh Shell TODO List

This document outlines the remaining features and improvements needed for the gosh shell implementation.

## Major Initiative: Record Streams with M28 Integration

Transform gosh into a data-oriented shell by implementing record streams. See [RECORD_STREAMS_DESIGN.md](RECORD_STREAMS_DESIGN.md) for detailed design.

### Phase 1: Core Record Infrastructure (High Priority)
‚ñ° **Record Protocol**
   - Define record types and serialization format
   - Implement RecordEmitter and RecordConsumer interfaces
   - Add --records flag to built-in commands (ls, ps, etc.)

‚ñ° **Basic I/O Commands**
   - from-json: Read JSON files/streams as records
   - from-csv: Parse CSV files with header detection
   - to-json: Output records as JSON
   - to-table: Pretty-print records in table format

‚ñ° **Pipeline Integration**
   - Modify pipeline executor to handle record streams
   - Add record-aware pipe operator
   - Environment variable for format negotiation

### Phase 2: M28 Stream Processing (High Priority)
‚ñ° **Lisp Stream Operators**
   - (map): Transform each record with a function
   - (filter): Select records matching a predicate
   - (reduce): Aggregate records to a single value
   - (take) / (drop): Limit record streams

‚ñ° **Inline Lisp Integration**
   - Parse inline Lisp expressions in pipelines
   - $ variable for current record access
   - Seamless conversion between shell and Lisp

‚ñ° **Stream Comprehensions**
   - (defstream): Define reusable stream processors

   - Nested field access with / notation
   - Array indexing with # notation
   - Fuzzy field matching with @ prefix
   - Wildcard field selection

‚ñ° **Aggregation Commands**
   - group-by: Group records by field values
   - aggregate: Compute statistics (sum, avg, count)
   - window: Time or count-based windows
   - pivot: Multi-dimensional aggregations

‚ñ° **Data Commands**
   - where: SQL-like filtering syntax
   - select: Project specific fields
   - join: Join multiple record streams
   - sort-by: Multi-field sorting

### Phase 4: Ecosystem (Low Priority)
‚ñ° **Format Support**
   - from-yaml / to-yaml
   - from-xml / to-xml  
   - from-log with pattern matching
   - Auto-detect format

‚ñ° **External Integration**
   - http command for API calls
   - to-sqlite / from-sqlite
   - to-chart for visualizations
   - Plugin system for custom formats

## Comparison with Zsh: Feature Delta Analysis

To make gosh a viable daily-driver shell, we need to understand what users expect from modern shells. Here's a comprehensive comparison with zsh, one of the most feature-rich shells available.

### ‚úÖ Features Gosh Already Has
- Basic command execution and pipes
- Job control (fg, bg, jobs, &)
- I/O redirection (including 2>&1, &>)
- Command history with persistence
- Tab completion (basic)
- Environment variables
- Command substitution
- Wildcard expansion (*, ?, [...], {...})
- Here-documents and here-strings
- AND/OR operators (&&, ||)

### üöÄ Gosh's Unique Advantages
- **M28 Lisp Integration**: Full programming language embedded in shell
- **Record Streams** (planned): First-class structured data processing
- **Python-like Syntax**: More approachable than traditional shell scripting
- **Data-Oriented Design**: Built for modern JSON/API workflows

### ‚ùå Critical Features Missing (High Priority for Shell Parity)

#### 1. **Shell Scripting via M28** ‚úÖ (Different Approach)
- [x] Control flow: M28 already has `if/elif/else`, `for`, `while`, `cond`, `case`
- [x] Functions: M28 has `def` with full Python-like capabilities
- [ ] Shell integration: Access to `$1`, `$2`, `$@`, `$*` from M28
- [ ] Exit status: Access to `$?` from M28 context
- [ ] Script debugging: M28 error messages and stack traces
- [ ] Source command: Load and execute .m28 files

#### 2. **Advanced Expansion and Substitution**
- [ ] Parameter expansion: `${var:-default}`, `${var:+alt}`, `${var:?error}`, `${var:=assign}`
- [ ] String manipulation: `${var#pattern}`, `${var%pattern}`, `${var/old/new}`
- [ ] Array expansion: `${array[@]}`, `${#array[@]}`
- [ ] Arithmetic expansion: `$((expression))`
- [ ] Brace expansion sequences: `{1..10}`, `{a..z}`

#### 3. **Directory Navigation**
- [ ] Directory stack (pushd, popd, dirs)
- [ ] CDPATH for quick navigation
- [ ] Auto-cd (type directory name to cd)
- [ ] Named directories (hash -d)
- [ ] Smart cd with fuzzy matching

#### 4. **Interactive Features**
- [ ] Command correction ("Did you mean...?")
- [ ] Shared history between sessions
- [ ] History substring search (Ctrl+R improvements)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting while typing
- [ ] Auto-suggestions based on history
- [ ] Programmable prompt with git status

#### 5. **Completion System**
- [ ] Context-aware completions
- [ ] Completion for command options/flags
- [ ] Customizable completion functions
- [ ] Remote file completion (scp, ssh)
- [ ] Git-aware completion
- [ ] Man page based completion

### üîß Nice-to-Have Features (Medium Priority)

#### 1. **Zsh Power Features**
- [ ] Associative arrays (hash maps)
- [ ] Floating-point arithmetic
- [ ] Extended globbing: `**/*.js`, `*.{jpg,png}`, `^pattern` (negation)
- [ ] Glob qualifiers: `*(.)` (files only), `*(/)` (dirs only), `*(m-7)` (modified in last week)
- [ ] Precommand modifiers: `noglob`, `nocorrect`
- [ ] Process substitution: `<()`, `>()`

#### 2. **Configuration and Customization**
- [ ] Multiple startup files (.goshenv, .goshrc, .goshlogin)
- [ ] Options system (setopt/unsetopt equivalents)
- [ ] Loadable modules
- [ ] Theme support
- [ ] Plugin architecture

#### 3. **Advanced Line Editing**
- [ ] Vi and Emacs modes with full keybindings
- [ ] Custom key bindings
- [ ] Multi-line editing with proper cursor movement
- [ ] Kill ring (yank/paste system)
- [ ] Undo/redo in command line

### üìä Implementation Priority Matrix

Based on user impact and implementation complexity:

**Immediate Priority (Makes gosh usable as primary shell):**
1. M28 shell integration (access to $1, $2, $?, shell command execution)
2. Parameter expansion
3. Better completion system
4. Shared history
5. Directory stack

**Second Wave (Improves daily use):**
1. Command correction
2. Syntax highlighting
3. Advanced globbing
4. Git prompt integration
5. Arithmetic expansion

**Third Wave (Power user features):**
1. Associative arrays
2. Extended glob qualifiers
3. Loadable modules
4. Theme system
5. Advanced line editing

### üéØ Strategic Approach

Rather than copying all zsh features, gosh should:
1. **Prioritize data processing**: Leverage M28 and record streams as the killer feature
2. **Modernize shell UX**: Better error messages, visual feedback, progressive disclosure
3. **Cherry-pick essentials**: Focus on the 20% of features that handle 80% of use cases
4. **Integrate with modern tools**: First-class JSON, API calls, cloud services
5. **M28 as the scripting language**: No need for bash/zsh scripting syntax - use M28's Python-like syntax for everything

This positions gosh not as "another zsh" but as "the shell for the API age" - combining traditional shell power with modern data processing capabilities.

### üìù M28 Shell Scripting Examples

Instead of traditional shell scripts, gosh users will write M28:

```lisp
#!/usr/bin/env gosh -m

# Traditional shell script functionality in M28
(def main (args)
  # Access command line arguments
  (= script-name (first args))
  (= params (rest args))
  
  # Control flow
  (if (empty? params)
    (print "Usage: {script-name} <file>...")
    (for file in params
      (process-file file)))
  
  # Exit status
  (if success 0 1))

# Shell command execution from M28
(def process-file (file)
  (try
    # Execute shell commands and capture output
    (= result (shell "grep -n TODO {file}"))
    (if result.stdout
      (print "TODOs in {file}:\n{result.stdout}")
      (print "No TODOs in {file}"))
    (except ShellError as e
      (print "Error processing {file}: {e.message}")
      (= success False))))
```

This eliminates the need for learning arcane shell scripting syntax while providing more power and better error handling.

ps --records | 
[r for r in records if r["cpu"] > 80] |
group-by user |
(def summarize (groups)
  (for (user, procs) in (items groups)

            "proc_count": (len procs)}))) |
[r for r in records if r["cpu_total"] > 200] |
to-alert "High CPU usage by user"

# Log analysis with M28 transformations  
from-log nginx.log |
(def parse_log (r)
  {**r,
   "response_time_ms": (float r["response_time"]),
   "hour": (datetime.strptime r["timestamp"] "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S").hour}) |
(map parse_log records) |
group-by endpoint hour |

[r for r in records if r["p95"] > 1000] |
to-chart --x hour --y p95 --group-by endpoint

# Multi-source data join with M28 classes
(class RecordJoiner
  (def join (self key records1 records2)
    (= index {})
    (for r in records2
      (= index[r[key]] r))
    (for r in records1
      (if r[key] in index

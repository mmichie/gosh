# gosh Shell TODO List

This document outlines the remaining features and improvements needed for the gosh shell implementation.

## Major Initiative: Record Streams with M28 Integration

Transform gosh into a data-oriented shell by implementing record streams. See [RECORD_STREAMS_DESIGN.md](RECORD_STREAMS_DESIGN.md) for detailed design.

### Phase 1: Core Record Infrastructure (High Priority)
‚ñ° **Record Protocol**
   - Define record types and serialization format
   - Implement RecordEmitter and RecordConsumer interfaces
   - Add --records flag to built-in commands (ls, ps, etc.)

‚ñ° **Basic I/O Commands**
   - from-json: Read JSON files/streams as records
   - from-csv: Parse CSV files with header detection
   - to-json: Output records as JSON
   - to-table: Pretty-print records in table format

‚ñ° **Pipeline Integration**
   - Modify pipeline executor to handle record streams
   - Add record-aware pipe operator
   - Environment variable for format negotiation

### Phase 2: M28 Stream Processing (High Priority)
‚ñ° **Lisp Stream Operators**
   - (map): Transform each record with a function
   - (filter): Select records matching a predicate
   - (reduce): Aggregate records to a single value
   - (take) / (drop): Limit record streams

‚ñ° **Inline Lisp Integration**
   - Parse inline Lisp expressions in pipelines
   - $ variable for current record access
   - Seamless conversion between shell and Lisp

‚ñ° **Stream Comprehensions**
   - (defstream): Define reusable stream processors

   - pivot: Multi-dimensional aggregations

‚ñ° **Data Commands**
   - where: SQL-like filtering syntax
   - select: Project specific fields
   - join: Join multiple record streams
   - sort-by: Multi-field sorting

### Phase 4: Ecosystem (Low Priority)
‚ñ° **Format Support**
   - from-yaml / to-yaml
   - from-xml / to-xml  
   - from-log with pattern matching
   - Auto-detect format

‚ñ° **External Integration**
   - http command for API calls
   - to-sqlite / from-sqlite
   - to-chart for visualizations
   - Plugin system for custom formats

## Bash Compatibility Gap

To understand what's needed for gosh to be a bash replacement, here's what's missing:

### üî¥ Critical Bash Features Not Yet in Gosh
1. **Parameter Expansion**: The `${var:-default}` family of expansions
2. **Arrays**: Both indexed `arr=(a b c)` and associative arrays
3. **History Expansion**: `!!`, `!$`, `^old^new`
4. **Arithmetic**: `$((2+2))`, `let`, `(( ))` constructs
5. **Aliases**: `alias` command for shortcuts
6. **Special Variables**: `$$`, `$!`, `$0`, positional parameters
7. **Startup Files**: `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` equivalents

### üü° Bash Features with Different Approach in Gosh
1. **Control Flow**: Bash uses `if/then/fi`, gosh uses M28 Lisp

### üéØ Strategic Approach

Rather than copying all features from other shells, gosh should:
1. **Prioritize data processing**: Leverage M28 and record streams as the killer feature
2. **Modernize shell UX**: Better error messages, visual feedback, progressive disclosure
3. **Cherry-pick essentials**: Focus on the 20% of features that handle 80% of use cases
4. **Integrate with modern tools**: First-class JSON, API calls, cloud services
5. **M28 as the scripting language**: No need for bash/zsh scripting syntax - use M28's Python-like syntax for everything
6. **Learn from fish's UX philosophy**: 
   - Sane defaults that work out of the box
   - Helpful, user-friendly error messages
   - Visual feedback (syntax highlighting, auto-suggestions)
   - Zero-configuration productivity

This positions gosh not as "another zsh" but as "the shell for the API age" - combining fish's excellent UX, traditional shell power, and modern data processing capabilities.

### üìù M28 Shell Scripting Examples

Instead of traditional shell scripts, gosh users will write M28:

```lisp
#!/usr/bin/env gosh -m

# Traditional shell script functionality in M28
(def main (args)
  # Access command line arguments
  (= script-name (first args))
  (= params (rest args))
  
  # Control flow
  (if (empty? params)
    (print "Usage: {script-name} <file>...")
    (for file in params
      (process-file file)))
  
  # Exit status
  (if success 0 1))

# Shell command execution from M28
(def process-file (file)
  (try
    # Execute shell commands and capture output
    (= result (shell "grep -n TODO {file}"))
    (if result.stdout
      (print "TODOs in {file}:\n{result.stdout}")
      (print "No TODOs in {file}"))
    (except ShellError as e
      (print "Error processing {file}: {e.message}")
      (= success False))))
```

This eliminates the need for learning arcane shell scripting syntax while providing more power and better error handling.
